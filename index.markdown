# Hello!
Welcome to my page of completed and in-progress transcriptions.
The transcriptions are hosted on this website (below) and also available on my [SoundSlice channel](https://www.soundslice.com/users/alex.w/).

I am not a trained musician nor do I interact with real musicians much, so the following transcriptions are bound to contain errors/mistakes/notational no-nos, etc.
Please comment in the corresponding SoundSlice link if there is anything like that, and I'll do my best to fix it. I'd love to hear from you!
